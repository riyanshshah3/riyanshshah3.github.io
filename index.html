      <h2>Why Axial Flux?</h2>
      <p>
        Axial Flux Permanent Magnet (AFPM) generators are revolutionizing the way we think about electricity. With high power-to-weight ratios and slim form factors, they are the perfect fit for small-scale, low-RPM renewable systems.

          <h3>Renewable Energy Generation</h3>
          <p>Axial flux technology is transforming renewable energy generation with its high efficiency, compactness, and low maintenance, making it ideal for wind turbines, micro-hydro systems, and human-powered generators. Compared to radial machines, axial flux generators offer shorter magnetic paths and higher power densities, improving energy conversion at lower RPMs. Companies like Emrax and Magnax produce axial flux generators rated from 1 kW to over 500 kW, with efficiencies exceeding 94%, ideal for direct-drive wind turbines that eliminate gearbox losses. Their flat geometry reduces nacelle weight and improves scalability for vertical and horizontal axis turbines. In off-grid and remote applications, axial flux designs enable portable, low-speed energy harvesters used in small-scale hydro, tidal systems, and human-powered devices like bicycle generators. The simplified construction, with air-gap winding and dual-rotor configurations, boosts cooling and minimizes energy loss, maximizing sustainability. Axial flux generators are enabling the next generation of decentralized, efficient, and resilient renewable power systems.</p>

          <h3>Regenerative Braking, EVs and Marine Applications</h3>
          <p>Axial flux technology revolutionizes electric mobility with its compact design, high torque density, and exceptional efficiency, making it ideal for regenerative braking, EVs, and marine propulsion. Unlike radial flux motors, axial flux machines shorten magnetic paths and reduce copper losses, achieving efficiencies over 96%. In EVs, companies like YASA (used in Mercedes-AMG EQS) and Magnax provide motors with outputs of 100–300 kW, torque densities above 15 Nm/kg, and significant weight savings. These features enhance braking energy recovery and vehicle range. In marine applications, axial flux motors reduce hull space usage while maintaining high thrust-to-weight ratios, vital for electric ferries and submersibles. Their flat, pancake shape supports easy integration and cooling. Regenerative braking systems benefit from the rapid dynamic response and high back-EMF capability of axial flux motors, allowing more efficient energy capture during deceleration. As the demand for compact, sustainable propulsion grows, axial flux designs are driving performance improvements across sectors.</p>
